Version 1.2 (?? ??? ????)
- Include date in search results.  If filename includes a string of
  the format 20101231 (example: "20120315 Results.pdf") that date will
  be used instead of the date processed.
- Removed files (or renamed files) will be handled now.  Prior to this,
  deleting a file would still leave its entry in the database.
Version 1.1 (13 Feb 2012)
- Added pagination support.  Configure $maxMatchesBeforePagination and
  $matchesPerPage in config.php.
- Updated scan.php to rescan files that were modified since the last scan
  (based on file modification time).
- Altered table structure to include new "title" column which will be
  used in the search results when it is not null.
  Version 1.0 users can upgrade their database with the following SQL:
    alter table edm_doc add column doctitle VARCHAR(256) NULL;
- Added tools/webcalendar.php (bundled in tools.zip) as a way of also
  indexing all events in a local WebCalendar installation.
- Added translations to different languages using WebCalendar's translations
  as a starting point.
