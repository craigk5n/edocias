# Brazilian Portuguese translation for v1.2 b1
# Translated by: Laurent Rondet (R Partners) - laurent@youkali.com.br
# (laurent-yk on sourceforge)
# Last update: 04/21/2008
# V 2.0
#
# Note: I Tried to use the existing translation file Portuguese_BR Rev. 1.0 but
# I believe it was working with previous versions and was missing too many
# translations that the tools/udate_translation.pl tool couldn't add (or I
# didn't use it correctly...) so I started a new file based on the distributed
# v1.2 b1 (25 feb 2008) English-US.txt file.
